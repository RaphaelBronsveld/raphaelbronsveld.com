    content: RSCs in React Router
---

A couple of weeks ago, the Remix team shared more [insights](https://remix.run/blog/react-router-and-react-server-components) into how RSCs will work with React Router. And after a bit of patience, while everyone’s excited, we finally get to [experiment](https://reactrouter.com/changelog#v770) with RSCs in React Router.

Assuming you're already somewhat familiar with RSCs and what they do, let’s ask the obvious question:

## Why would we want this?

### Advantages

- RSCs render on the _server_ only (it's quite literally in the name). The only thing that gets sent (streamed) to the client is some serialized data that represents the component. Since the component code never gets sent to the browser, we can also use some "heavier" dependencies like database clients without it impacting your client-side JS bundle.
- Reducing latency, especially in optimizing the time it takes for content to appear for users.
- You can use backend resources directly inside components without exposing them to the client. This enables you to create a tighter backend integration.

## How about RSCs in React Router?

> ⚠️ **Note: Everything is still unstable!**

We had to be a little patient… but following the RSC [docs](https://reactrouter.com/how-to/react-server-components), we get a glimpse of what the future _might_ look like. So I thought, why not give it a shot and try moving this website over to use RSCs?

### Initial impressions

While scanning through the example [template](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router-templates/tree/main/unstable_rsc-vite), I noticed the following changes. Most of these APIs and implementation details will probably change again, but I reckon it's still valuable to see what's there right now.

- React Router itself is no longer used as a Vite plugin. Instead, `@vitejs/plugin-rsc/plugin` is used with 3 entry files.
- Instead of `entry.server.tsx` and `entry.client.tsx`, we now have:
  - `entry.browser.tsx` Hydrate the generated HTML + support post-hydration server actions.
  - `entry.rsc.tsx` Will generate the RSC payloads
  - `entry.ssr.tsx` Responsible for handling the incoming request and generating HTML with fetched RSC payloads.
- A different (?) routes configuration with `RSCRouteConfig`. Truth be told: I haven't actually tried playing around with the `@react-router/dev/routes` helper functions here.

### Migrating blog to RSC

Blogs are a great candidate for Server Component routes they’re static by nature and I don’t require interactivity at this moment in time.

I made a start [here](https://github.com/RaphaelBronsveld/raphaelbronsveld.com/commit/dd76bb03ef3d9fe453a748584f57d2b381246cf6), and (unsurprisingly) the Vercel deployment failed, since it’s still using the old build setup. I just wanted to get it working locally.

The migration went relatively smoothly. I updated the Vite config, added the new entry points, converted the homepage to an RSC route, and made sure everything rendered as expected.

The only part I’m a bit unsure about is the `<ClientLayout>` component being used [here](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router-templates/blob/main/unstable_rsc-vite/src/routes/root/route.tsx#L9-L10).

Me, being slightly ignorant (and curious), moved everything to the main `root` route and only set up a `"use client"` component for the root error boundary. So far, it works, but I’m still trying to figure out whether that layout component is necessary or just redundant.

### Loader vs RSC

### Performance

### TL;DR

React Router now has experimental support for React Server Components. I tried moving a small part of this project over. Setup was fairly straightforward, and I got it working locally quite quickly.

If you’re feeling adventurous, definitely give it a spin locally! Just expect stuff to break :)
