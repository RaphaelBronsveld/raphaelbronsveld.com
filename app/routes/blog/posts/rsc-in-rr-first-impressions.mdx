    content: RSCs in React Router - First Impressions
---

A couple of weeks ago, the Remix team shared more [insights](https://remix.run/blog/react-router-and-react-server-components) into how React Server Components (RSCs) will work with React Router. And after a bit of patience, we finally get to [experiment](https://reactrouter.com/changelog#v770) with RSCs in React Router (yes üéâ!).

Assuming you're already somewhat familiar with RSCs and what they do, let‚Äôs ask the obvious question:

## Why would we want this?

Some of the advantages of utilising React Server Components..

- RSCs render on the _server_ only (it's quite literally in the name). The only thing that gets sent (streamed) to the client is some serialized data that represents the component. Since the component code never gets sent to the browser, we can also use some "heavier" dependencies like database clients without it impacting your client-side JS bundle.
- Reducing latency, especially in optimizing the time it takes for content to appear for users.
- You can use backend resources directly inside components without exposing them to the client. This enables you to create a tighter backend integration.

## What about RSCs in React Router?

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note: Everything is still unstable!**

We had to be a little patient‚Ä¶ but following the RSC [docs](https://reactrouter.com/how-to/react-server-components), we get a glimpse of what the future _might_ look like. So I thought, why not give it a shot and try moving this website over to a React Router with RSCs app?

### Initial impressions

While scanning through the example [template](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router-templates/commit/2fb1d62477a1c3ffa36969419c4aa0921a0d6aa9), I noticed the following changes. Most of these APIs and implementation details will probably change again, but I reckon it's still valuable to see what's there right now.

- React Router itself is no longer used as a Vite plugin. Instead, `@vitejs/plugin-rsc/plugin` is used with 3 entry files.
- Instead of `entry.server.tsx` and `entry.client.tsx`, we now have:
  - `entry.browser.tsx` Hydrate the generated HTML + support post-hydration server actions.
  - `entry.rsc.tsx` Will generate the RSC payloads
  - `entry.ssr.tsx` Responsible for handling the incoming request and generating HTML with fetched RSC payloads.
- A different (?) routes configuration with `RSCRouteConfig`. Truth be told: I haven't actually tried playing around with the `@react-router/dev/routes` helper functions here.

## Migrating my blog to RSC

Blogs are a great candidate for Server Component routes since they‚Äôre static by nature and I don‚Äôt require interactivity at this moment in time.

I made a start [here](https://github.com/RaphaelBronsveld/raphaelbronsveld.com/commit/dd76bb03ef3d9fe453a748584f57d2b381246cf6), and (unsurprisingly) the Vercel deployment failed, since it‚Äôs still using the old build setup. I just wanted to get it working locally.

The migration went relatively smoothly. I updated the Vite config, added the new entry points, converted the homepage to an RSC route, and made sure everything rendered as expected.

The only part I‚Äôm a bit unsure about is the entire `<ClientLayout>` component being used [here](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router-templates/commit/2fb1d62477a1c3ffa36969419c4aa0921a0d6aa9#diff-a1ea4cd0c7d6d0fa0875c00b1a6eca71c5861ab752acac644961d11a75301710R9-R10).

Me, being slightly ignorant (and curious), moved everything to the main `root` route and only set up a `"use client"` component for the root error boundary. So far, it works, but I‚Äôm still trying to figure out whether that layout component is necessary or just redundant.

## Loader vs RSCs

If you've been working with React Router / Remix for the past few years already, the concept of a `loader` shouldn't be something new to you. You'd export a server `loader` in your Route module, fetch some data and return it. I predict the future of the `loader` function will be more related to, for example, managing response status codes rather than returning data.

```tsx
export async function loader({ params }: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  const post = await db.getPost(params.id);
  return post;
}

export default function Post({ loaderData }: Route.ComponentProps) {
  const { title, description } = loaderData;
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <p>{description}</p>
    </article>
  )
}
```

This approach will work for years to come but you might also consider a RSC approach where you'd fetch the data from your component directly.

```tsx
export default async function Post() {
  const post = await db.getPost(params.id);
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.description}</p>
    </article>
  )
}
```

To be entirely honest, I wouldn't be able to tell you what the actual difference is. It'll generate the same output, but it's obviously an entirely different way of dealing with fetching data.

Since RSCs can be async, we can also stream (slower) RSCs to the client!

```tsx
// movies/page.tsx
export default async function MoviePage() {
  const lotr = movieApi.fetchTheLordOfTheRingsExtendedTrilogy();
  return (
    <>
      <Suspense fallback={<ABeautifulLoader />}>
        <MovieClientPage movie={lotr} />
      </Suspense>
    </>
  )
}

// movies/page.client.tsx
"use client"
export function MovieClientPage({ movie }) {
  const movieData = use(movie);
  return <MovieDetail data={movieData} />;
}
```

If you're curious about how the example above works. Go to the React [docs](https://react.dev/reference/react/use#streaming-data-from-server-to-client) to read more about this :) !

## Performance

Just for fun I decided to run
```shell
autocannon -c 50 -d 30 http://localhost:5173
```
on the homepage with a RSC route and the OG Route module that's just returning the homepage (basically static html). Nothing too fancy, and probably an absolutely worthless test but the funny thing was that the RSC route would always be able to process more requests.

Should we draw conclusions from this? Yes move everything over now!! (just kidding)

When implementing RSCs just be mindful of the potential performance issues _you_ can introduce. It's a powerful tool but since it's so different from what we're used to.. here are some things you can keep in mind.

- Use Suspense boundaries where needed, RSCs WILL "block" your navigation until the server component is done executing.
- n+1 queries. You create a "list" component where each child RSC fetches data? Not good.

## TLDR

React Router now has experimental support for React Server Components. I tried moving a small part of this project over. Setup was fairly straightforward, and I got it working locally quite quickly.

If you‚Äôre feeling adventurous, definitely give it a spin locally! Just expect stuff to break :)
