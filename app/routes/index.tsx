				<p>
					I'm an all-around developer, performance nerdðŸ¤“, and Iâ€™m passionate
					about making the web faster, and better for everyone.
				</p>
				<p>
					I build and maintain web applications, focusing on integrating 3rd
					party services, improving user experience, and figuring out where to
					take things next.
				</p>
				<p>
					I like solving tricky & complicated problems while jumping straight
					into the source code. I'm always trying to learn more and finding ways
					to make a difference.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I'm not coding I still like to write about my experiences and
					figure it out together. I'll mostly write about web focused topics
					such as React development, performance, accessibility, deep-dives into
					specifics & more!
